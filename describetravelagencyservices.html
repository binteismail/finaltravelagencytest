   <p>A travel agency is a business that offers and sells travel deals to its customers. It acts as a mediator between consumers and the various service providers present on the tourism market: tour operators, airlines, hoteliers, Car Rental Companies, travel insurance, etc.
    
    Travel agencies, by virtue of their proximity to the customer, also have an advisory role. They notify consumers about the formalities that need to be completed before they travel abroad or stay abroad, advise and make a personal offer in accordance with the customer’s expectations and preferences. Let’s look at the services that travel agencies provide to make our journey stress-free.</p>

    Although travel agencies have not been spared by technological advancements and have been forced to evolve as travelers become more demanding and better informed, they have always been a means of consultation. Travel matters; whether through the Internet, telephone, social networks, or physically, the services and products they make available to the customer remain virtually the same from their inception.

    If you are going to places close to your place of origin, you will likely rent a bus or car or need a boat or cruise to travel by sea. And for example, looking to get between two continents, you may need the means of transport the airplane. A travel agency can provide all types of transport, whether sea, air, rail, or land.

    The combination and interconnection of geographically separate destinations constitute a unique offer of tourism services when grouped together. These are excursions organized in different cities with regular departures that facilitate the preparation of itineraries for travelers. A tourist circuit begins and ends at the same place and does not cross the same place twice.

    In itself, this is a kind of tourist package. These are sea trips, normally in a territorial area (several countries), aboard a cruise with all the services necessary to stay there (accommodation, catering, and attractions). During the tour, you will stay in the ports of the visited tourist destination for a while so that the traveler has the opportunity to get off and find out if it’s convenient for you.
    
    <h3>WHAT ROLE DOES A TRAVEL AGENCY PLAY?</h3>
    Acting as a mediator between travelers and travel creators, the travel agency provides unmatched service for the smooth running of your stay in your own country or abroad.<br>
    
    It responds to tourist demand and targets the most popular destinations and the most remote destinations. It takes care of many areas, including ticket sales and reservation, routing, and hotel reservations. The travel agency helps to facilitate the organization of the trip both nationally and internationally. It guarantees the progress of the trip for tourists so that they can find comfort and total satisfaction. A travel agency is a commercial enterprise that a tangible or legal person can manage.<br>
    
    It performs services for tourists, for individual or group stays. Moreover, travel agencies welcome and advise private or professional tourists. It has the ability to offer various services and must meet customer expectations. By definition, the agency sells travel offers to tourists, professionals, individuals, and consumers. It must warn and inform customers in the event of a flight cancellation or the event of a major problem relating to the reservation of the ticket and accommodation.<br>
    
    These agencies also make itineraries for the tour packages they offer. That is primarily used to identify the starting point, destination, and shopping place for a tour. This configuration contains many elements designed after good market analysis.<br>
    
    The travel agency also informs the formalities to be completed before travel. It also offers tailor-made or personalized offers according to customer expectations. Overall, the travel agency sells products from tour operators. Nevertheless, it has the capacity to organize the stays of the tourists and the entire organization of the trip going to the booking of the flight, the movement of the clients, the car rental, the hotel reservation, and the travel.<br>
    
    They provide clients with additional services such as travel insurance. This insurance protects you in case of injury or loss of luggage while traveling. This is usually related to problems or situations that you may encounter while traveling. Travel agencies also issue government currency exchange permits.<br>
    
    Thus the activities of the travel agency are variable and multiple. Tourists all over the world can take advantage of the benefits offered by the travel agency. They can expect from the travel agency a turnkey stay where all the organization of the trip will be taken care of by the travel agency.<br>
    
    Nowadays, travel agencies play an essential role in travel and tourism. On average, more than 60% of travel agency revenue comes from business travel. They offer both commercial and recreational activities, and everything is online. That’s why they offer online booking. You don’t have to go out, just stay home, visit their sites and make a booking. These agencies are striving to build good relationships with customers.<br>
